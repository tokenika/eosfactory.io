Welcome to EOSFactory documentation!
======================================

`EOSFactory <https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory>`_ is a Python-based EOS smart-contract development framework, created by `Tokenika <https://tokenika.io>`_.
With a single command-line interface you can create a private testnet and then compile, unit-test and deploy `EOS <https://eos.io/>`_ smart-contracts.
All of this using simple yet powerful `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ syntax.
