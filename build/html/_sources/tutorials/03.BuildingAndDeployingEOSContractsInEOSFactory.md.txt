# Building and Deploying EOS Contracts using *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how you can use *EOSFactory* to execute the simplest development cycle: create a new contract, edit the code, build the contract, deploy it and interact with it.

## Prerequisites

* This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [Installing EOSFactory](01.InstallingEOSFactory.html).
* We also assume that you are familiar with the material covered in [Interacting with EOS Contracts in EOSFactory](02.InteractingWithEOSContractsInEOSFactory.html).
* Finally, we assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS Hello World tutorial](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/hello-world).

## Run Python CLI in VSC

Open a bash terminal and run Python CLI:

```
python3
```

Once in the Python shell, import the *EOSFactory* library:

```
from eosfactory.eosf import *
```

## Create a new contract from template

To create a new contract from a pre-defined template all you need is a name for the contract and the name of the template, for example:

```
contract = ContractBuilder(project_from_template("foo_bar", template="01_hello_world"))
```

**NOTE:** Do not use spaces in contract names. What is allowed are letters, numbers, underscores `_`, dots `.` and dashes `- `. Regarding the second parameter, as of now there are three templates to choose from (i.e. `01_hello_world`, `02_eosio_token` and `03_tic_tac_toe`), with more coming in the future. This parameter is optional, the default value isÂ `01_hello_world`.

## Create reference to an existing contract

The above command creates a new folder and inside it a new smart-contract file is placed. However, if you want to access an existing smart-contract, use the following syntax and specifying the entire path, for example:

```
contract = ContractBuilder("/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/contracts/foo_bar")
```

Or use just the folder name, if the contract is located in the workspace you explicitly defined when installing *EOSFactory*:

```
contract = ContractBuilder("foo_bar")
```

In a similar way, you can access demo contracts shipped with *EOSFactory*, for example:

```
contract = ContractBuilder("01_hello_world")
```

## Edit the source code

To check the directory where the contract's files are located:

```
contract.path()
```

Locate the folder containing the new contract (if you're not sure where it is, use the output produced by the `contract.path` method) and edit the `foo_bar.cpp` file in your favorite text editor by commenting out line `18`, i.e. `require_auth( user ) `:

```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>

#define DEBUG

#include "logger.hpp"
#include "hello.world.hpp"

using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
    using contract::contract;

    [[eosio::action]]
    void hi( account_name user ) {
      logger_info( "debug user name: ", name{user} );
      //require_auth( user );
      print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
    }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```


## Build the new contract

You can generate ABI and the web assembly code separately:

```
contract.build_abi()
```

```
contract.build_wast()
```

Or you can generate both at the same time:

```
contract.build()
```

## Deploy the contract

First, start the testnet and initialize the workspace:

```
reset()
create_master_account("master")
```

Then create an account which will be holding the contract:

```
create_account("host", master)
```

Next, let's redefine the contract, so that it's associated with the above account and thus becomes deployable:

```
contract = Contract(host, contract.path())
```

Or you can use the name of the contract's folder (provided it's located in your smart-contract workspace):

```
contract = Contract(host, "foo_bar")
```

Or you can use the entire path to the contract's folder:

```
contract = Contract(host, "/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/contracts/foo_bar")
```

Next, we can deploy the contract:

```
contract.deploy()
```

**NOTE:** In a similar way you could deploy a demo contract supplied by *EOSFactory*, for example:

```
contract = Contract(host, "01_hello_world")
contract.deploy()
```

Or a demo contract supplied by *EOSIO*, for example:

```
contract = Contract(host, "eosio.token")
contract.deploy()
```

## Test the contract

First, let's create a couple of testing accounts:

```
create_account("alice", master)
create_account("carol", master)
```

You can play with the contract by sending it actions with different arguments:

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=alice)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":carol}, permission=carol)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=carol)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":carol}, permission=alice)
```

**NOTE:** The `push_action` method takes three parameters:

* the name of the action, e.g. `"hi"`,
* the data required by the action, e.g. `{"user":alice}`,
* the permissions required by the action, e.g. `alice`.

Regarding permissions, *EOSFactory* offers several options:

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, alice)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=alice)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=(alice, Permission.ACTIVE))
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=[(alice, Permission.ACTIVE), (carol, Permission.OWNER)])
```

All the above variations should work, as the contract allows anyone to authorize the `hi` action.

**NOTE:** Among other things, the console displays a debugger output, for example:

```
INFO debug user name: alice @ 12:26:05 hello.world.cpp[17](hi)
```

This is the result of a `logger_info` clause in the `foo_bar.cpp` file (line `17`):

```
logger_info( "debug user name: ", name{user} );
```

## Modify the code, re-compile & re-deploy

And now let's modify the `hi` method by uncommenting line `18`, so that that contract authenticates the user before further execution:

```
void hi( account_name user ) {
  logger_info( "debug user name: ", name{user} );
  require_auth( user );
  print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
}
```

Re-compile the contract:

```
contract.build()
```

And re-deploy the contract:

```
contract.deploy()
```

Now, if we attempt to mismatch the user and the authority, the contract will throw an error:

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=carol)
```

```
Error 3090004: Missing required authority
Ensure that you have the related authority inside your transaction!
```

But if we use the appropriate authority, there should no error:

```
contract.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, permission=alice)
```

## Clean up

When your are done your contract, you might want to delete it from your workspace:

```
contract.delete()
```

**NOTE:** The above command removes the entire folder.

To stop the testnet:

```
stop()
```

To exit Python CLI:

```
exit()
```

Alternatively, use the `ctrl-D` shortcut.
