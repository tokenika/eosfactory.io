# Installing *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install *EOSFactory* on any operating system, including Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows.

We've tested *EOSFactory* on the following platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
- Windows 10 (version 1803)

**NOTE:** *EOSFactory* is compatible with *EOSIO* [v1.5.x](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

## General prerequisites

We assume that you have successfully installed *EOSIO* [v1.5.0](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (or higher) on your machine.

As of version [v2.3](https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory/releases/tag/v2.3), *EOSFactory* supports both *EOSIO* built from the source code (as described in [this guide](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/getting-the-code)) and *EOSIO* deployed from binaries (as described in [this guide](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/setting-up-your-environment)).

*EOSIO* deployed in Docker is NOT supported.

If you build *EOSIO* form source files, make sure to install *EOSIO* with this command after the build is complete:

```
sudo ./eosio_install.sh
```

As of version [v2.3](https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory/releases/tag/v2.3), *EOSFactory* uses *EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit* (CDT) to build smart-contracts. For installation instructions please follow [this guide](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/installing-the-contract-development-toolkit).

## Prerequisites for Ubuntu & MacOS

* We assume you have installed [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher).
* We assume you have installed [pip 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher).

## Prerequisites for Windows

- We assume that you have [*Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu 18.04*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804/9n9tngvndl3q) installed.
- The only option you have regarding *EOSIO* installation is building it in the Ubuntu 18.04 bash (supplied by WSL), as it cannot be compiled directly on a Windows machine. What we recommend is clone the *EOSIO* source code in Windows and keep it in the Windows file structure, yet build it in WSL, taking advantage of the fact that the entire Windows file structure is fully accessible in WSL.
- And finally, we assume you have [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-356/) (or higher) available in your WSL, but this condition is likely to be already satisfied, as WSL ships with Python 3.6.5 by default. Also make sure your WSL has [pip 18.1](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (or higher) installed.

## Upgrading from previous version

If you have a previous installation of *EOSFactory* on your machine, please remove all *EOSFactory* export statements from your system.

To do this, edit the `.profile` or `.bash_profile` file:

- If you are on Ubuntu or *Windows Subsystem for Linux*:

  ```
  nano ~/.profile
  ```

- If you are on MacOS:

  ```
  nano ~/.bash_profile
  ```

And make sure that all *EOSFactory* export statements are removed:

```
export EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR=...
export EOSFACTORY_DIR=...
export HOME=...
export eosf=...
export EOSIO_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE_MB=...
export EOSIO_CONTRACT_WORKSPACE=...
export PYTHONPATH=...
```

Also, if you're on Ubuntu make sure there are no similar export statements in the `~/.bashrc` file. If there are any, remove all of them.

When you're done, restart your console to apply the change.

## Install on Ubuntu & MacOS

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

Open a bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```
cd eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `~/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Install on Windows

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

**NOTE:** We recommend keeping *EOSFactory* in the Windows file structure, not WSL.

Open a WSL bash terminal and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```
cd /mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory
```

Then run the `install` script by pointing it to the *EOSIO* source code:

```
./install.sh
```

When prompted, supply the path pointing to the location of your smart-contract workspace, e.g. `/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/contracts`. It has to be existent, so if you don't have it already, you need to create it manually.

## Verify the installation

Now let's verify that EOSFactory works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO*.

First, make sure your working directory is switched to `eosfactory`:

```
cd eosfactory
```

And then run those three tests:

```
python3 tests/01_hello_world.py
python3 tests/02_eosio_token.py
python3 tests/03_tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Troubleshooting specific errors

#### Case 1

If the test fails due to the `can't open file 'tests/01_hello_world.py'` error, make sure your current working directory is `eosfactory`.

#### Case 2

If a unit tests fails due to the `execve` error, make sure you have executed the `eosio_install.sh` script after *EOSIO* build, as described above.

## Troubleshooting general problems

First, make sure *EOSFactory* configuration is correct by running this command:

```
cd eosfactory
python3 utils/config.py
```

As a result, you should get data similar to this:

```
"CONFIG_FILE": "/Users/sygnet/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/config.json",
"EOSIO_ABIGEN": "/usr/local/bin/eosio-abigen",
"EOSIO_CLI_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/local/bin/cleos",
"EOSIO_CONTRACT_WORKSPACE": "/Users/sygnet/Workspaces/EOS/contracts",
"EOSIO_CPP": "/usr/local/bin/eosio-cpp",
"EOSIO_GENESIS_JSON": "/Users/sygnet/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/localnode/genesis.json",
"EOSIO_KEY_PRIVATE": "5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3",
"EOSIO_KEY_PUBLIC": "EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV",
"EOSIO_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE_MB": "200",
"EOSIO_WORKSPACE": null,
"KEOSD_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/local/bin/keosd",
"KEOSD_WALLET_DIR": "/Users/sygnet/eosio-wallet/",
"LOCAL_NODE_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8888",
"LOCAL_NODE_CONFIG_DIR": "/Users/sygnet/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/localnode/",
"LOCAL_NODE_DATA_DIR": "/Users/sygnet/Workspaces/EOS/eosfactory/localnode/",
"LOCAL_NODE_EXECUTABLE": "/usr/local/bin/nodeos",
"NODEOS_STDOUT": null,
"NODE_API": "cleos",
"NODE_IN_WINDOW": 0,
"WALLET_MANAGER_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:8888",
"WSL_ROOT": null
```

Next, verify that all the above paths are resolved.

## Subsequent installations

If you want to upgrade to the latest version of *EOSFactory*:

```
cd eosfactory
git pull
```

And then just run:

```
./install.sh
```
