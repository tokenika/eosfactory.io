# Long-term EOSFactory Roadmap

Ultimately, we are aiming for building a base of tutorials and pattern articles that could help any interested reader to learn EOS Smart Contract techniques and experiment with them.

All the articles are going to be expressed in terms of the EOSFactory API, and they are going to be mutually compatible.

Exemplary origin of this knowledge base is in [`docs/cases`](http://eosfactory.io/build/html/index.html#use-cases) and [`docs/patterns`](http://eosfactory.io/build/html/index.html#patterns) directories of EOSFactory repository.

We will gratefully accept suggestions and contribution from the community about the contents of the database.
