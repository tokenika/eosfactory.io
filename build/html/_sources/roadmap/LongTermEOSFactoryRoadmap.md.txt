# Long-term EOSFactory Roadmap

#### Support for other IDEs

Right now we are aiming for integration with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSC), but we also consider supporting other IDEs, e.g. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

#### Ricardian Contracts

We are thinking about integrating *Ricardian Contracts* into our unit-testing. This is a very interesting (and probably not widely known at this  stage) aspect of EOS smart-contracts. For more information please refer to [EOSIO documentation](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/hello-world).
