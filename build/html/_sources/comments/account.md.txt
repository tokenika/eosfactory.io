# Account Object

This article demonstrates how the concept of EOSIO account is applied in *EOSFactory*.
We present how to create an account object, associate it with a contract and then execute some actions of this contract.

## Create a new account

Create a new Python session and import *EOSFactory* API:

```bash
python3
```

```python
from eosfactory.eosf import *
```

Start a local testnet, create a wallet and then create a special MASTER account referenced by a global variable called `MASTER`:

```python
reset()
create_master_account("MASTER")
```

>**NOTE** If you write a script, you can use alternative syntax:

```md
MASTER = new_master_account()
```
>This syntax does not work interactively.

Next, use the `MASTER` account to create another account referenced by a global variable called `HOST`:

```python
create_account("HOST", MASTER)
```

The first argument is the name of variable to be created, the second one points to the `MASTER` account, which we created in the previous step.

>**NOTE** If you write a script, you can use alternative syntax:

```md
HOST = new_account(MASTER)
```
>This syntax does not work interactively.

You can verify that the variable exists and its methods can be invoked, for example:

```python
HOST.info()
```

Here is the expected outcome:

![create account](../images/create_account.png)

The `create_account` command performs several tasks:

* verifies that a `Wallet` object exist in the namespace,
* verifies that the proposed variable name is not already taken,
* registers a new account on the testnet - this account has its own name generated randomly,
* using the proposed name, creates a global variable referencing the actual account on the testnet,
* opens the wallet, unlocks it and stores the account's private keys into it,
* and finally, updates its internal statistics tracking all accounts created in a similar way.

All the above actions are logged to the terminal, which can be visible, provided the verbosity is set to its default value.

### Account objects reside in the global namespace

Account objects reside in the global namespace (of the script module). This fact raises instinct reaction of python practitioners as they know that globals are evil. 

We are determined to defend our design decision.

The globals are [considered](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil) bad in any programming language. But global constants are perfectly fine to use. The account object variables are constants of a smart contract tests because the physical EOSIO accounts, that they represent, are eternal. 

The reason that globals are bad is that they allow functions to have hidden and thus hard to understand side effects, **if they change** any of module globals.

In Python, there is no syntactic difference between constants and variables.
With Python, adhering to good practices is then the only general method of reliable programming. With constants, good practice is to make constants uppercase. Then, assigning a value to an uppercase variable is a conscious decision. 

Also, it helps that Python globals are local *to their modules*. Then, it is impossible that one programmer sets a constant *variable* to a value of an EOSFactory account object, and another programmer in another module redefines this constant just accidentally.

With EOSFactory, a special argument holds. As EOSFactory is for tests, scripts written with it should be composed of functions enclosing a complete live-cycle of a set of EOSIO actors. Thus, each such a function starts with resetting all the account objects (command `eosf.reset()`). Then, the programmer has to concentrate themselves only within the scope of the current test function.

We can propose EOSFactory good practice: if you do not want global constants in your program, do not use them. Account object global constants, marked with the upper case treat as constants are to be treated -- newer rebind those introduced with EOSFactory `create_` factory functions. 

Finally, we admit that there are methods for having our constant account objects immutable, thus closing the controversy at the expense of decorating these objects with qualifiers, while our method results in clear and compact scripts (account variables not obscured with namespace qualificators). We believe that clearness is the first paradigm of the Python, and this is the reason that we have chosen Python. However, if the community insists, we will implement their way in the next editions.

### Account objects have to be unique in the test module

The account objects in EOSFactory have to be unique in the test module. If they 
were not, two different account objects could use (modify) the same physical 
EOSIO account, or two different local objects, if account objects could be not global constants, having the same object name (representing the same actor), could refer to different physical accounts.

See how EOSFactory defends itself against attacks against uniqueness.

```python
create_account("HOST", MASTER)
```
```bash
######## Account object ``HOST`` restored from the blockchain.
```
```python
create_account("HOST", MASTER, str(HOST))
```
```bash
######## Account object ``HOST`` restored from the blockchain.
```

## Methods of the Account class

An instance of the `Account` class has the following methods:

* `info()` - list the account's information,
* `push_action()` - push an action to the smart-contract,
* `show_action()` - display a `JSON` file of a transaction without sending it to the blockchain,
* `table()` - list the content of the local database associated with the smart-contract.

**NOTE:** the `MASTER` account is an instance of a different class (i.e. the `AccountMaster` class) which does not implement the above methods. As a consequence, you cannot associate a smart-contract with an instance of the `AccountMaster` class.

### Create a contract object

Create an instance of the `Contract` class and associate it with the `HOST` account:

```python
contract = Contract(HOST, "hello_world")
```

The second argument of the creator of the `Contract` class identifies the location of the contract's source code (you can supply the entire path, but in case of standard locations, e.g. *EOSFactory* demo contracts or your predefined workspace, you can just specify the folder name).

Next, let's build and deploy the contract:

```python
contract.build()
contract.deploy()
```

### Execute the contract

If the deployment succeeds, the contract can be executed.

First, create two accounts - `alice` and `carol`:

```python
create_account("alice", MASTER)
create_account("carol", MASTER)
```

And then you can push actions of the contract stored at the `HOST` account, using those two other accounts as arguments:

```python
HOST.push_action("hi", {"user":alice}, alice)
HOST.push_action("hi", {"user":carol}, carol)
```

You can also try the `show_action` method:

```python
HOST.show_action("hi", {"user":alice}, alice)
```

**NOTE:** As the `hello_world` does not define any tables, in this case the `table` method will not work.

Here is the expected outcome:

![execute contract](../images/execute_contract.png)

Finally, stop the local testnet and exit Python CLI:

```python
stop()
```

## Test run

The python blocks in the current Markdown document can be executed with a provided bash tool. While the working directory is the root of the `EOSFactory` installation, do:

```bash
eosfactory/pythonmd.sh docs/comments/account.md
