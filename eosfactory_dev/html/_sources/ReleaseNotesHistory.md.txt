# Release Notes History

* Release 0.8 on 17 May 2018

    * Launch a single-node private testnet and fully control it: stop it and then continue running it or completely reset it.
    * Initialize a testnet with the `bios` contract and several test accounts (available as `sess.alice`, `sess.bob ` and `sess.carol`).
    * Create additional test accounts (their keys are automatically imported into the wallet).
    * Manage the wallet (locking, unlocking etc).
    * Have an easy access to demo contracts stored in the `contracts` folder of the *EOSIO* source code (you can instantiate them in EOSFactory by passing their folder name in the `Contract` class constructor).
    * Compile a contract, both `ABI` & `WAST` (but please note that the ABI compiler has an experimental status in *EOSIO* repository).
    * Create a new contract from a pre-defined template (this includes the creation of its [CMake](https://cmake.org/) files).
    * Deploy a contract (the account holding the contract is created behind the scenes).
    * Interact with a contract by pushing actions to it.
    * Extract data from a contract's table.

* Release 1.0 on 6 Jun 2018

    * Integration with Python UnitTest standard library.
    * User-defined workspace for smart-contract storage.
    * Support for debugging via logger output containing file name & line number.
    * Preliminary code verification with CLANG.
    * Visual Studio Code integration, including CMake builds and automated tasks.

* Release 1.1 on 11 Jul 2018

    * Full compatibility with production version of EOS (v1.0.8 or higher).
    * Ability to interact with a public testnet (e.g. Jungle Testnet).
    * Support for keosd, the official wallet management tool.
    * Built-in mechanism for mapping random account names to fixed names needed for smart-contract testing.
    * Color differentiation in console output.
    * Improved error reporting.

* Release 2.0 on 13 Sep 2018

    * Full compatibility with production version of EOS (v1.2.0 or higher).
    * Seamless integration with public testnets (e.g. Jungle Testnet or Kylin Testnet).
    * The entire wallet management migrated to keosd.
    * Radically improved mechanism for mapping random account names to human-friendly aliases, including symbolic translation of EOS logger messages.
    * New mechanism for caching public testnet settings.
    * Developer API reduced to less than 20 basic commands and classes.
    * Radially improved logger messaging, including highly customizable verbosity.

* Release 2.1 on 25 Sep 2018

    * Local testnet running in a headless mode (this allows you to run EOSFactory in a GUI-less environment, e.g. Ubuntu Server, or via SSH).
    * All functionality ported to Python, no need to compile any C++ code.
    * Precise error catching in unit tests, utilizing Python's assertRaises(Error) feature.
    * Improved folder structure within Python modules.
    * Simplified syntax for logger management.

* Release 2.2 on 30 Oct 2018

    * Completely removed dependence on system variables: entries in the ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile files are no longer needed.
    * Radically improved (and simplified) installation process: the Python modules are now installed with setuptools.
    * While using EOSFactory with Visual Studio Code is highly recommended, EOSFactory has become independent from any particular IDE and does not impose any particular folder structure inside your smart-contract project. The only requirement is having a folder called build on the same level or one level up from your C++ source files.

* Release 2.3 on 10 Dec 2018

    * Compatibility with EOSIO v1.5.0
    * Support for binary version of EOSIO (while support for a source code build is maintained)
    * Smart-contract are built using EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit (CDT)
    * Support for setting account and action permissions
    * Optional nodeos output to file
    * Several bug fixes

* Release 2.4 on 4 Jan 2019

    * General code overhaul & clean-up.
    * Documentation improved & revised.
    * Introduction of code patterns.
    * Several bug fixes.


* Release 3.0.2 on 5 Mar 2019

    * New alternative syntax introduced for creating references to EOS accounts: `foo = new_account(...)`.
    * EOSFactory package can be installed from PyPi repository.
    * Compatibility with python linter: now linter doesn't raise warnings about dynamically created account objects.
    * Cleaner code, better documented.

* Release 3.1.1 on 8 May 2019

* Release 3.1.3 on 23 May 2019
