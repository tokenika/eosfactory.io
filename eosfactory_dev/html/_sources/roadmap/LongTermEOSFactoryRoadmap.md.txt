# Long-term EOSFactory Roadmap

Ultimately, we are aiming for building a base of tutorials and pattern articles that could help any interested reader to learn EOS Smart Contract techniques and experiment with them.

All the articles are going to be expressed in the framework of the [EOSIDE](https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/index.html) which is an Integrated Development Environment, in the terms of [EOSFactory](https://eosfactory.io/eosfactory_dev/html/index.html) API, and they are going to be mutually compatible.

Exemplary origin of this knowledge base is in [`docs/cases`](https://eosfactory.io/eosfactory_dev/html/index.html#use-cases) and [`docs/patterns`](https://eosfactory.io/eosfactory_dev/html/index.html#patterns) directories of EOSFactory repository.

Also, we are going to provide videos explaining the basis of the EOS Smart Contract technology, as seen by a user of the [EOSIDE](https://eosfactory.io/eoside/html/index.html) framework. Certainly, the medium of video is the easiest stimulation of interest in our work.

We will gratefully accept suggestions and contribution from the community about the contents of the database.
